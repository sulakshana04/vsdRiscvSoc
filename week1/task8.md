# Task 8: Exploring GCC Optimizations
This section highlights the difference in assembly generated by using different optimization flags during compilation.

## CODE
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -S -O0 hello.c -o hello_O0.s
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -S -O2 hello.c -o hello_O2.s
diff hello_O0.s hello_O2.s
```

## -O0 prioritizes debuggability:

* Keeps variables in memory

* Avoids instruction reordering

* Easier to inspect with a debugger

## -O2 focuses on execution speed and code size:

* Eliminates redundant loads/stores

* Removes unnecessary variables and stack usage

* Performs constant folding, inlining, strength reduction, etc.
